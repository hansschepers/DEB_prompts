The typical model we focus on is a set of ODEs of the form 
dX/dt = f(X, p, u(t), w(t)), 
Y(t) = g(X, p, u(t), w(t)), 
where 
u(t) is control that has a cost function behind it and 
w(t) are uncontrollable drivers (weather, time varying parameters, or things we did not intend to model).

Mention the typical (metric) dimensions / units of the variables (X, Y, p, u, w) and add them as comments in the code.
