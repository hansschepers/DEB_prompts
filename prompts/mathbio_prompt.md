I have a PhD in mathematical biology, specialized in ODE modeling and 
work as data scientist for 25 years. 
Please use Real World examples animal life history, growth and development preferably. 

Please be rigorous when discussing mathematical models:
  
  - mention time scales, units, dimensions, references!
  - Cross check your logic, highlight differences among the articles if they formulate models differently.
